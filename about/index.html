  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
  I'm Steve Valaitis, a father, and software developer in Dallas, TX; who is
  passionate about writing code, enjoys living an active lifestyle, and spending
  time with my wife and daughters. I am driven to excel in any task that I take
  on, and try to always be a better Me today than I was yesterday.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have been doing full-stack development professionally for about {{year | minus:2000}} 
    years. I actually started programming when I was 10 years old, and found a copy of Visual
    Basic my mom had lying around from some computer purchase. Since then I have
    learned and used a variety of languages in both business and personal
    settings. I continually strive to expand my knowledge, and stay at the edge
    of the curve.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the early part of my career I tended towards Microsoft technologies, but
    was always left a little frustrated at the lack of community. Around the
    mid-00s I started to shift towards the open source community, and
    immediately felt like it was where I belonged. The feeling of sharing,
    cooperation, and helping other developers be better was what it seemed like
    software development should be. I thoroughly enjoy contributing to projects
    that I use when I can to do my part in the community.
  </p>
  <p>
    To keep myself active and sane I coach youth soccer, play soccer myself, and
    strength train. I feel that the activities I do in my personal time have
    tremendous carryover to my professional life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Coaching gives me the opportunity(just like open source) to
    give back. I feel very privileged to be able to pass on my knowledge to help
    these children learn a skill, and responsibility and it is very rewarding
    to see them put that into practice and be successful. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Playing soccer gives me the opportunity to work with a group to accomplish
    a task, and to compete and test myself against others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Strength training is solely about me. To me it's about coordinating my mind
    and body to achieve one single task. There are few more objective
    measurements of a person than saying, "Can you move more weight today than
    you could yesterday?"
  </p>
  <p>
    Any free time I have that isn't spent learning, coaching, playing, or
    training is usually spent with my wife and two daughters.
